  <h2 slot="heading">What has happened and why?</h2>
  <p>We changed your payment from <b>£30.30</b> to <b>£25.26</b>, based on your [Meter read type].</p>
  <h3>We did this because:</h3>
  <ul class="ul-bullet">
    <li>We estimate that you’ll use more energy for your gas but less energy for your electricity</li>
    <li>There have been no changes to the cost of kWh per hour for either fuel</li>
    <li>There have been no changes to your tariff for either fuel</li>
    <li>It will cover what you've underpaid for your gas and what you've overpaid for your electricity</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 slot="heading">How does this affect you?</h2>
  <p>We’ve included all changes in your new payment amount.</p>

    <li>You’ve paid us £181.80 so far.</li>
    <li>You still need to pay £151.51 over your next six payments.</li>
    <li>Your payments have gone up to cover what you’ve underpaid so far.</li>
    <li>By paying this amount and using the same amount of energy, you won’t owe us anything at the end of your payment plan.</li>

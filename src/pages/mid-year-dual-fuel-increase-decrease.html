  <h2 slot="heading">How does your monthly Direct Debit work?</h2>
  <p>You are paying by Direct Debit with a fixed amount every month. We check your Direct Debit amount against your meter readings halfway through your plan and again at the end to make sure you’re paying the right amount.</p>
  <p>We do this to try and make sure you don’t end up in credit or debit on your account at the end of your plan.</p>

  <h2 slot="heading">What has happened and why?</h2>
  <p>We changed your payment from <b>£30.30</b> to <b>£25.26</b>, based on your [Meter read type].</p>
  <h3>We did this because:</h3>
  <ul class="ul-bullet">
    <li>We estimate that you’ll use more energy for your gas but less energy for your electricity.</li>
    <li>There have been no changes to the cost of kWh per hour for either fuel.</li>
    <li>There have been no changes to your tariff for either fuel.</li>
    <li>It will cover what you've underpaid for your gas and what you've overpaid for your electricity.</li>
  </ul>
</ns-editorial>

<ns-editorial>
  <h2 slot="heading">How does this affect you?</h2>
  <p>We’ve included all changes in your new payment amount.</p>
  <h3>Here is a breakdown:</h3>
  <ul class="ul-bullet">
    <li>You’ve paid us <b>£181.80</b> so far.</li>
    <li>You still need to pay <b>£151.51</b> over your next six payments.</li>
    <li>Your payments have gone down to cover what you’ve overpaid so far.</li>
    <li>By paying this amount and using the same amount of energy, you won’t owe us anything at the end of your payment plan.</li>
  </ul>

      <p>You’ve probably heard about GDPR in the news. GDPR stands for General Data Protection Regulation. It’s a set of EU rules that aim to give you more control over your personal data. That includes making it easier and faster for you to get in touch with companies like us when you need to check or change your data.</p>
      <p>We’ve put together a video to explain how we use your data, how we keep it safe and how you’re always in control of it. If you have any questions, get in touch with our Data Protection Officer.</p>

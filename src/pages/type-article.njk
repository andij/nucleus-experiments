      <h1>Leaving British Gas</h1>

      <h2>I want to leave British Gas. How do I switch my energy supplier?</h2>
      <p>We’re sorry you want to leave and don’t want to see you go. If you’re not happy with your tariff, please <a class=" " href="#callus">give us a call</a>. Also, don’t hesitate to talk to us if you’re thinking of leaving for any other reason. If it’s a supply or service issue, we’ll look into it for you.</p>
      <p>At the moment, we’re offering some great prices on switching to new British Gas Evolve - affordable energy that puts you in control. Find out more at <a href="http://www.britishgasevolve.co.uk/">www.britishgasevolve.co.uk</a></p>
      <p>If we must go our separate ways, you can cancel your contract at any time and switch away from us. You’ll need to agree a new contract with the new supplier first and this can only be done by the account holder. You don’t have to tell us as the change is made automatically. We’ll continue to supply and bill you up until the point when the switch is made. But do allow up to six weeks for everything to complete.</p>

      <h2>Do I need to submit a final meter reading to British Gas?</h2>
      <p>Your new energy provider will ask for an opening meter reading to start your supply and this will be passed on to us. This way, the point at which your energy bills start with them and end with us will be the same. We’d use that reading to close your British Gas account, so it’s important that it’s accurate to avoid having to use an estimated reading for your final bill.</p>

      <h2>I pay by Direct Debit – should I cancel it?</h2>
      <p>Please leave it active and we’ll take care of this for you. Once we’ve worked out your account balance, we may need to take a final payment. This may be a different amount to that which you normally pay. If the final bill is larger than you anticipated and you think you’ll have difficulties with paying, we can offer a payment plan to help spread the cost. On the other hand, you may have paid too much. If this is the case, you’ll be due a full refund through your bank account. Either way, we’ll let you know the final balance figure within four weeks after switching.</p>

      <h2>What if I owe you money when I switch?</h2>
      <p>If you have a large outstanding balance, you’ll need to pay this before we can close your account. However, if it’s only a small amount to pay, it wouldn’t get in the way of you switching away from British Gas. If you’re not sure, you can always <a class=" " href="#callus">give us a call</a>.</p>

      <h2>What if you owe me money?</h2>
      <p>Any overpayment you’ve made will be refunded to you in full through your bank account or sent by cheque. Rest assured that you’ll get this as soon as we’ve received a final reading and have worked out your closing balance.</p>

      <h2>When will I get a final bill?</h2>
      <p>Typically, it can take about four weeks to close your accounts with British Gas and send you any final bills. We need to agree with your new energy supplier that the opening meter reading you submit follows on from the previous readings we have for you on our records. If it all goes smoothly, your final bill(s) will be available within four weeks. It may take a little longer if there’s a query.</p>

      <h2>Will my smart meter still work if I switch?</h2>
      <p>Some of the earlier smart meters may lose some functionality when you switch to another supplier. However, it will still record your usage, but you’ll have to submit readings like you would with an old-style meter. This is a common problem with all early smart meters and the energy industry is working towards restoring their ‘smart’ capabilities by 2022.</p>

  <h2 slot="heading">What is the Priority Services Register?</h2>
  <p>Our Priority Services Register is a free support service for people who may be vulnerable.</p>

  <h2>Who is it for?</h2>
  <p>Perhaps because of their age, health or disability, or if they're going through a difficult time in their lives.</p>

  <h3><b>You can register</b> if:</h3>
  <ul class="ul-bullet">
    <li>You are over 65.</li>
    <li>You have a disability or long-term illness.</li>
    <li>You rely on medical equipment in your home.</li>
    <li>You have a child or children under the age of five.</li>
    <li>You have gone through a recent bereavement, break-up or job loss.</li>
    <li>You are recovering from a hospital treatment.</li>
    <li>You are living independently for the first time.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>When you register</h2>
  <p>By registering, you can receive services such as large print or Braille bills and free gas safety checks. We will also share your data with your network operator, who will get in touch if your electricity supply is going to be interrupted. They’ll help you figure out what to do to stay safe.</p>

  <h3>Register by phone now</h3>
  <p><code><span>Nucleus NOTE:</span> Why are there two phone numbers?</code></p>

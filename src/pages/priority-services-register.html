  <h2 slot="heading">What is the Priority Services Register?</h2>
  <p>Our Priority Services Register is a free support service for people who may be vulnerable – perhaps because of their age, health or disability, or if they’re going through a difficult time in their lives.</p>
  <h2>When you register</h2>
  <p>By registering, you can receive services such as large print or Braille bills and free gas safety checks. We will also share your data with your network operator, who will get in touch if your electricity supply is going to be interrupted. They’ll help you figure out what to do to stay safe.</p>

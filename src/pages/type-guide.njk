  <h2 slot="heading">What is dual fuel tariff?</h2>
  <ns-content>
    <p>It’s when you get both your gas and electricity from the same energy supplier.</p>
    <h3>Dual fuel is more convenient</h3>
    <p>With your gas and electricity bills combined, you'll receive one less bill each month – bonus. Plus, you'll only have to think about calling one provider, using one site, one app, and having one standing order or Direct Debit. Half the hassle, basically.</p>
    <h3>Do everything in one place</h3>
    <p>It’s easier to manage your account with only one password to remember, all your meter readings on the same site and only one company to contact if you’ve got questions.</p>
    <h3>See all your usage at a glance</h3>
    <p>Some energy companies will even send you a combined bill, with your total energy consumption conveniently explained in one place.</p>

  <h2 slot="heading">Dual fuel is often cheaper</h2>
  <ns-content>
    <p>As well as being more convenient, switching to a dual fuel tariff can save you money. This is because many companies will reward your loyalty with discounted prices.</p>
    <h3>Ask your current suppliers</h3>
    <p>It’s easy to switch – contact your individual electricity and gas providers to see what deals they’ll give you for moving to dual fuel.</p>
    <h3>Remember to compare deals</h3>
    <p>Be sure to shop around to compare prices with other providers, making sure you’re getting the best deal.</p>

      <h3 slot="heading">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
      <ns-expander>
        <h4 slot="heading">What happens if you can't fix my problem?</h4>
        <p>It’s up to you. Our engineer will tell you straightaway and talk you through your options. If you decide not to go ahead with the work, you won’t be charged.</p>
      </ns-expander>
      <ns-expander>
        <h4 slot="heading">What happens if you find more than one problem?</h4>
        <p>Your quote is only for the work we've already agreed with you. If it’s related to the original problem, we’ll repair it as part of our fixed price. If there are any unrelated faults, for example if you’ve called us about a leaking pipe but ask us to fix a blocked drain, we'll provide a separate quote for each repair. We’ll then cover future repairs to your plumbing and drains for 12 months.</p>
      </ns-expander>
      <ns-expander>
        <h4 slot="heading">What if I still have questions about repairs?</h4>
        <p>Just give us a call on <a href="tel:03332029567">0333 202 9567</a>. We’re here all day, every day to help. We may record calls to help improve our service to you. Calls to 0330/0333 numbers will cost you no more than 01 or 02 numbers from landlines or mobiles. If you get 'inclusive minutes' with your package, calls to 0330/0333 numbers will be part of these.</p>
      </ns-expander>
      <ns-expander>
        <h4 slot="heading">And if I want to cancel?</h4>
        <p>If we haven’t started work on your boiler, you have a 14-day cooling-off period beginning the day we deliver any parts OR the day you accept our quote (assuming the job needs labour, but no extra parts). If you’ve asked us to start the work before the 14-day cooling-off period finishes, we’ll charge you for the work we’ve already done and any parts we’ve installed for you. If you’ve gone for the repair and ongoing cover option and you want to cancel your cover, you'll have a cooling off period of 14 days from the day the cover starts or, if later, the day you receive your policy documents. You might have to pay a cancellation charge if we’ve already done work under your HomeCare agreement</p>
      </ns-expander>
      <ns-expander>
        <h4 slot="heading">What should I do if I already have HomeCare?</h4>
        <p>If you already have HomeCare, you can go ahead and book your repair from&nbsp;<a href="/identity">your online account</a>. You don’t need to choose the repair and cover or the one-off repair options.</p>

    <div slot="paragraph">
      <p>It’s the landlord’s biggest worry, a tenant who suddenly stops paying the rent. You’ve probably got a mortgage to pay on the property, and other expenses like buildings insurance and maybe a service charge.</p>
    </div>
    <div slot="paragraph">
      <p>So we’ve put together some hints and tips to help you spot the problem early and take steps to try to make sure you’re not out of pocket.</p>

  <h2 slot="heading">1. Check your bank account</h2>
  <p>On the day the rent is due, check your bank account to make sure the payment has arrived. A day or so late could be down to the bank, any longer and you need to contact your tenants.</p>
</ns-editorial>

<ns-editorial image="https://andijcdn.sirv.com/nds/testcard-4x3.png?scale.width&#x3D;768&amp;text.0.text&#x3D;480x360&amp;text.0.position&#x3D;center&amp;text.0.outline.width&#x3D;2">
  <h2 slot="heading">2. Talk to your tenants</h2>
  <p>As soon as you notice the rent is late, call your tenants and ask they why politely. (There’s no sense in escalating a situation that could be resolved amicably). There could many reasons, and some should concern you more than others.</p>
  <h2>Most common reasons for late payments</h2>
  <ul class="ul-bullet">
    <li>A mistake by the bank.</li>
    <li>Your tenant simply forgot to transfer the money.</li>
    <li>They’re having temporary cashflow problems.</li>
    <li>Your tenant has been made redundant.</li>
    <li>Your tenants were a couple but now they’ve split up.</li>
    <li>Your tenant is experiencing difficult personal issues like bereavement, stress or mental-health difficulties.</li>
    <li>Your tenant is simple refusing to pay the rent. This could be because of a dispute about the property so ask them to detail (in writing) what this is.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you contact your tenants quickly, you may be able to sort out the problem before the debt gets so big they can’t pay it. If it’s simply forgetfulness or a temporary cashflow problem, agree a date when you’re going to get your money. And send them a letter detailing exactly what you’ve agreed.</p>
</ns-editorial>

  <h2 slot="heading">3. Keep records</h2>
  <p>Keep accurate records of all letters, emails, phone calls and payments. If you can’t resolve the situation amicably you may have to go to court. So you need to be able to prove that you took all reasonable (and legal) measures to resolve the situation.</p>
</ns-editorial>

<ns-editorial image="https://andijcdn.sirv.com/nds/testcard-4x3.png?scale.width&#x3D;768&amp;text.0.text&#x3D;480x360&amp;text.0.position&#x3D;center&amp;text.0.outline.width&#x3D;2">
  <h2 slot="heading">4. Try to come to an agreement</h2>
  <p>If you talk to your tenant early, you may be able to reach a compromise. If the tenant is temporarily unemployed, you might decide to reduce the rent for a period while they find another job. If they’ve been reliable up until now you might not want to lose a good tenant – and if you do them a favour they’re more likely to make paying the rent their top priority.</p>
  <h2>Document your agreement</h2>
  <p>Anything you agree needs to be documented, so everyone knows what they’re signing up to. If you agree a rent reduction for 6 months for example, send a letter to your tenant and get something in writing to say they’ve understood and agreed to the arrangement.</p>
</ns-editorial>

<ns-editorial>
  <h2 slot="heading">5. Is there a guarantor?</h2>
  <p>Did someone agreed to guarantee your tenant’s rent when they signed the tenancy agreement, a friend or relative for example? Write to them and tell them about the rent arrears. They’ll be keen to help you resolve the situation so they don’t end up being liable for the money themselves.</p>
  <p>If you can’t reach an agreement with the tenant, you may have to take action to recover the rent from the guarantor.</p>
</ns-editorial>

  <h2 slot="heading">6. The tenant refuses to communicate with you</h2>
  <p>If your tenant is unresponsive, you may have to start eviction proceedings. There are two ways to do this.</p>
  <h2>Less than 2 months remaining</h2>
  <p>If there’s less than two months to run on a fixed term tenancy, or you have a periodic tenancy in place, you can serve your tenant with a Section 21 notice.</p>
  <h2>More than 2 months remaining</h2>
  <p>Once your tenant hasn’t paid the rent for two months, you can serve them with a Section 8 notice. Use this if the tenancy agreement has longer than two months left to run.</p>
  <h2>Take legal advice</h2>
  <p>If you’re unsure which notice to use, you might want to take legal advice – especially if your tenant is contesting your claim for repossession. They might be saying the property is in disrepair. If that’s the case, try talking to them again and offer to make any reasonable repairs to the property.</p>
</ns-editorial>

<ns-editorial>
  <h2 slot="heading">7. Collecting your unpaid rent</h2>
  <p>Once you’ve started eviction proceedings, the only way to get the rent arrears may be through the courts. You can also claim any reasonable costs. However, even if the court finds in your favour, if your tenant has no money they may be unable to pay you what they owe.</p>
  <h2>Cutting your losses</h2>
  <p>So think carefully before you go down this route. Legal fees can be expensive. You might be better off cutting your losses, getting your property back and finding a new tenant.</p>
</ns-editorial>

<ns-editorial image="https://andijcdn.sirv.com/nds/testcard-4x3.png?scale.width&#x3D;768&amp;text.0.text&#x3D;480x360&amp;text.0.position&#x3D;center&amp;text.0.outline.width&#x3D;2">
  <h2 slot="heading">8. Check tenants’ references carefully</h2>
  <p>Reference checks are never 100% reliable because your tenant’s situation can change during their tenancy. They could be made redundant, for example, or split up with a partner and not be able to afford the rent on their own. However, rigorous checks on tenant’s renting and credit history are an important tool for every landlord.</p>
  <h2>Types of checks and reference methods</h2>
  <p>You could choose to use your letting agent or another professional to carry pre-tenancy checks. You can also do quite a lot of the work yourself. For example, you could ask to see: an employment contract or letter from your tenant’s employer recent payslips or bank statements proof of benefit entitlement.</p>
  <p>You could also run checks with a credit agency such as Experian or Equifax – but you must ask the tenant’s permission to do this (if they refuse, you may draw your own conclusions).</p>
  <p>You can also ask for references from a current or previous landlord, and from your tenant’s employer. They should be happy to give these.</p>
  <p>If you’re unsure about your tenant’s ability to pay the rent, you could ask for a guarantor (see point 5) or simply find another tenant. Remember to run the same credit checks on the guarantor.</p>

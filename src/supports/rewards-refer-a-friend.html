    <h3 slot="heading">Frequently asked questions</h3>

    <ns-expander open="false">
      <h4 slot="heading">Who can refer a friend?</h4>
      To be able to refer a friend, you’ll need to be an existing British Gas customer with a home energy
      account. You’ll also need to have an online account with us. British Gas employees and any people
      who work for us can’t refer a friend.
    </ns-expander>

    <ns-expander open="false">
      <h4 slot="heading">How do I refer a friend?</h4>
      Referring a friend is simple – you just need to access your online account, or set one up if you haven’t
      already. Don’t forget, you need to be an existing British Gas customer to refer a friend. After we verify
      your details, we’ll give you a unique referral link which you can then send to as many friends as you
      like. Access your online account
      <a aria-label="Opens in new window" href="/identity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>
      to see your link.
    </ns-expander>

    <ns-expander open="false">
      <h4 slot="heading">What does my friend need to do after I’ve referred them?</h4>
      To be eligible for a referral reward, your friend needs to use your unique referral link to switch their
      energy to us, via 
      <a aria-label="Opens in new window" href="//www.britishgas.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.britishgas.co.uk</a>.
      You can find more details of our qualifying products 
      <a aria-label="Opens in new window" href="/aem6/content/dam/britishgas/rewards/refer-a-friend/refer-a-friend-terms.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.
      <br><br>
      It’s important that your friend uses your unique referral link – otherwise you won’t receive your gift cards.
      That’s because we won’t be able to tell that you referred them.
    </ns-expander>

    <ns-expander open="false">
      <h4 slot="heading">What reward will we get?</h4>
      Your reward is based on the product your friend purchases on
      <a aria-label="Opens in new window" href="//www.britishgas.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.britishgas.co.uk</a>.
      If they switch their electricity and gas, you’ll both get a £50 Amazon.co.uk Gift Card <a aria-label="Skip to caveat section" href="#caveat">1</a>.
      Or if they choose to only switch one, you’ll both get a £25 Amazon.co.uk Gift Card
      <a aria-label="Skip to caveat section" href="#caveat">1</a>. See
      <a aria-label="Opens in new window" href="/aem6/content/dam/britishgas/rewards/refer-a-friend/refer-a-friend-terms.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>
      for more details.
    </ns-expander>

    <ns-expander open="false">
      <h4 slot="heading">When will we get our gift cards?</h4>
      After your friend uses your unique link to join British Gas, we’ll need a little time to set up your friend’s
      account and check that the terms below have been met.<br><br>
      <ul class="ul-bullet">
        <li>If they’re switching their energy, they must not have had a British Gas energy contract within the last three months.</li>
      </ul>
      If your friend makes a qualifying purchase, but cancels their agreement within 60 days of their supply start date,
      you won’t receive your gift card. And if they decide to switch to a different British Gas product within 60 days of 
      their supply  start date, we’ll amend the value of your gift card to reflect their new product choice.<br><br>
      We’ll send you your gift card within three months of your friend joining British Gas. You can find full terms and conditions 
      <a aria-label="Opens in new window" href="/aem6/content/dam/britishgas/rewards/refer-a-friend/refer-a-friend-terms.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.
    </ns-expander>

    <ns-expander open="false">
      <h4 slot="heading">Can I refer a friend that’s already with British Gas?</h4>
      You can refer any friend looking to switch their energy, but only if they aren’t already a British Gas customer for that product.<br><br>
      That means<br><br>
      <ul class="ul-bullet">
        <li>If you refer a friend to energy, they can’t already have energy with British Gas</li>
        <li>You can’t refer yourself</li>
      </ul>
      Every friend you refer needs to use your unique referral link to buy a qualifying product on britishgas.co.uk 
      – otherwise we won’t be able to send you your gift card.
    </ns-expander>

    <ns-expander open="false">
      <h4 slot="heading">How many friends can I refer?</h4>
      You can refer as many friends as you like. And there’s no limit on the number referral bonuses you can earn,
      provided you and your friend meet the terms of the Refer a friend programme.
    </ns-expander>

    <ns-expander open="false">
      <h4 slot="heading">My friend has completed a purchase on britishgas.co.uk using my unique referral link, but I haven't received my gift card. What should I do?</h4>
      Once your friend has joined British Gas we’ll need a little time to do some checks – this can take up to three months.
      If you haven’t received your gift card within three months, check that you both meet the terms of the promotion.<br><br>
      <ul class="ul-bullet">
        <li>Did your friend use your unique referral link when switching their energy online?</li>
        <li>
          Is your friend new to British Gas?
          <ul>
            <li>If your friend switched their energy to British Gas, make sure they didn’t have energy with us in the three months before joining</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Does your friend still hold the qualifying product 60 days after their supply start date?</li>
      </ul>
      If you’ve met all the terms of the promotion and you don’t think your reward should have been cancelled,
      please email 
      <a aria-label="Opens in new window" href="mailto:support@refer.britishgas.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support@refer.britishgas.co.uk</a>.<br><br>
      We hope you enjoy our Refer a Friend programme. But if you’re unhappy about anything, please let us know via the
      <a aria-label="Opens in new window" href="//www.britishgas.co.uk/complaints.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complaints section</a>
      complaints section on our website. We’re always looking to improve what we do, so we appreciate any feedback you have.

  <h2 slot="heading">All the things you need to know about using the British Gas website and app</h2>
  <p>This is an agreement between you and British Gas Trading Limited (registered number 03078711) and/or British Gas Services Limited (registered number 03141243) (together "British Gas"). Our registered office is Millstream, Maidenhead Road, Windsor, Berkshire SL4 5GD. British Gas is a Centrica business.</p>

  <p>By using our website and downloading, installing or using our app and by accepting any app updates from time to time, you acknowledge that you have read and agree to these terms. If you don't accept the terms, don’t use the website or app. We will use your information in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</p>

  <p>Want to read these terms and conditions on paper? Feel free to print them out.</p>

  <p>We last updated this page in October 2018.</p>

  <h2>Your British Gas account</h2>
  <p>You can access your British Gas account online at any time. We also have an app available to download.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>You can access your account securely using details to identify yourself, providing they match what we currently hold for you.</p>
  <p>Before accessing your account for the first time, we’ll ask you to set a password. Keep your password to yourself. Don’t share it with anyone, even us, and never write it down.</p>
  <p>If you think someone might know your password, change it straight away online.</p>

  <h2>If we need to talk to you</h2>
  <p>From time to time, we may need to contact you about your account. We’ll normally do that by email, which is why we need a valid email address from you.</p>
  <p>If you change your email address, please go to your account to update it as soon as possible.</p>

  <h2>Making changes</h2>
  <p>We’ve got the right to remove or stop supplying any product, service or function on our website or app at any time. It’s your responsibility to read the terms and conditions regularly to make sure you’re aware of any changes.</p>
  <p>If you use the website or app after we’ve changed something, we’ll take this to mean you’ve accepted the changed terms and conditions.</p>

  <h2>Intellectual property</h2>
  <p>The copyright, trademarks and all other intellectual property rights in the material contained on this website or our app belong to us or their licensed owner. This includes database rights, design rights, rights in know-how, rights in inventions (whether registered or unregistered), patents and all rights to apply for registration.</p>
  <p>You are permitted to use this material or content only as expressly authorised in writing by us or our licensors. You will not, and you will not assist or facilitate any third party to, copy, reproduce, transmit, distribute, frame, commercially exploit or create derivative works of such material or content. If you become aware of any such distribution or commercial exploitation, you agree to notify us immediately.</p>
  <p>The images, logos and names on this website or app are to identify us, a British Gas company or any other organisation and their products and services. They’re our trademarks or the trademarks of the other organisation. Nothing on this website or app gives anyone any licence or right to use any image, logo or name.</p>

  <h2>Jurisdiction and law</h2>
  <p>The products and services described on this website and app are only available in the UK. The laws of England and Wales apply to these terms and conditions. If there’s a dispute about these terms and conditions, it’ll be dealt with in the courts of England and Wales (unless you live in Scotland, in which case, Scottish laws apply).</p>

  <h2>Links to other websites or external sources</h2>
  <p>Certain links on this website or app will take you to other sites or external sources that we don’t control. When you click these links, you’ll leave our website or app. Because we don’t control these websites or apps, we won’t accept any responsibility or liability for the material you find there.</p>
  <p>We won’t accept any responsibility or liability for the websites or external sources we frame.</p>

  <h2>Monitoring phone calls and emails</h2>
  <p>We may monitor and record our calls and emails, so we can find out where we need to improve and check we’re keeping to our normal practices and procedures.</p>

  <h2>Product terms and conditions</h2>
  <p>If you buy any product or service we’ve mentioned on this website or app, you should check these terms and conditions, and the terms and conditions of the product or service itself. If there’s any contradiction between the two, the specific terms and conditions of the product or service will apply.</p>

  <h2>Our liability</h2>
  <p>Nothing in these terms limits our liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence, fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation or for any matter that we cannot exclude or limit as a matter of law.</p>
  <p>We provide the website and app free of charge and on an "as is" basis. To the extent permitted by law, (a) we disclaim any warranties, express or implied, and (b) other than as set out above, we are not liable for any loss or damage — direct or indirect and whether arising in contract, tort, or otherwise — even if we have been advised of the possibility of this loss or damage.</p>
  <p>These limitations don’t affect your statutory rights under the Consumer Rights Act 2015, if applicable and any laws that replace it. If you want independent advice about your rights, you can speak to Citizens Advice or Trading Standards.</p>

  <h2 slot="heading">How we're doing</h2>
  <p>We resolved a total of 137,660 complaints in Q3 which is 1,163 complaints per 100k customer accounts.</p>

  <h2>What happened in Q3 2019?</h2>
  <ul class="ul-bullet">
    <li>We saw a decrease in the proportion of complaints resolved on the same or next working day and a decrease within eight weeks compared to last quarter. Resolving complaints quickly remains a key priority for us, and we are introducing at new ways of working to ensure we do this. Our continued investment in customer service includes providing further training for our people, as well as improving our processes and systems.</li>
    <li>We’re working hard to reduce the number of complaints referred to the Ombudsman Service. It is our intention to always resolve complaints quickly, without the need for our customers to escalate issues. We received 1,748 Ombudsman complaints in Quarter 3, which is just 10.8% of the total complaints taken on by the Ombudsman across all suppliers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What does the Ombudsman do?</h2>
  <p>They take on complaints if we haven’t resolved them within eight weeks or if we’ve sent you a final position letter, you may choose to escalate this to the Ombudsman for them to take a look.</p>
  <p>We work closely with the Ombudsman to help us understand why customers escalate their complaints to them. This helps us to improve our internal policies and procedures to reduce the need for escalation to the Ombudsman or other organisation.</p>

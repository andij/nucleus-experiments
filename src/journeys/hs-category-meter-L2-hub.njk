        <h4 slot="heading">How do I top up for the first time?</h4>
        <p>If it's your first time topping up, you'll need to activate your key or card in your meter first.</p>
        <h2>Activating your card</h2>
        <ul class="ul-bullet">
          <li>Put your key or card into the meter for at least a minute to activate it.</li>
          <li>Top up your key or card at a convenient <a>Payzone</a> or <a>Post Office</a>.</li>
          <li>Put the key or card into your meter. Electricity credit will transfer automatically. For gas, press and hold the red button 'A' to transfer the credit to the meter.</li>
        </ul>

      <ns-expander open="false">
        <h4 slot="heading">Where can I find a Payzone to top up?</h4>
        <p>You’ll find <a>Payzones</a> in newsagents, supermarkets and garages. Just look for the logo – you’ll spot them outside all Payzone outlets.</p>
        <p>Payzone outlets are often open long hours and some may be open seven days a week. Don’t forget you’ll need to top up by at least £5, and you'll always need to top up to the nearest pound. So you can't add £8.50, but you could add £8 or £9.</p>
        <p>We will soon be changing our minimum top up policy. <a>Find our more here</a>.</p>
